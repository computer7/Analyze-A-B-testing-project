# Analyze-A-B-testing-project
This project will cover statistics concepts
In this is project I will do A/B testing on e-commerce website , the company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
The goal of this project is to work through the notebook to help the community understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Steps
 1- Answer all of the questions
2- Make sure to answer what the e-commerce company should do in light of the results
3- Double the check the code to make it efficient in places where I used inefficient solutions

4- Add comments were necessary

5- Submit
